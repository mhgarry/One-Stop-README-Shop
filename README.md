## Description
  
    1. Application description: A simple prompt based multiple choice tool that gives web developers, software developers, and anybody else who may need it a quick and easy way to write README files for their projects and applications.
    2. I built this app I built a command line README generator using Node.js in my coding bootcamp and it has been a huge timesaver for me when it comes to writing READMES for subsequent projects. Since a command line application is relatively niche in scope I'd love to make this software easily accessible to other developers in the form fo a light weight web application.
    3. This app One Stop README Writer generally saves at least 5 minutes of formatting and brainstorming a README file  for a specific application by doing all of the formatting for and heavy lifting for you. 

## Installation
  
    This is a web application so the user simply needs to go to "url goes here", answer the prompts, and a download link to their .md file will be generated to be used in their project.
     Refer to https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository for information on cloning a repository

## Usage

    Simply go to the "url specified" and go through the prompts until you are at the end of questions and your README.md is generated.

## Packages

    undefined

## Features
  
   One Stop README Writer gives the end user the ability to generate a unique, organized, templated README.md file, including an index, and various sections with a fraction of the effort of user writing and formatting their own README.md file.
  
## Resources
  
   I built this application using Node.js, Express, and React among others. 
  
## Tests

   A user can test my application by going through the prompts and inspecting the generated results and making sure they match up correctly with their inputted answers.
